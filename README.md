## Description
Scared about investing in the stock market? Not sure how to start? Donâ€™t worry! Jx Funds is a full CRUD application where users can come together as a community and add Index Funds that they want to recommend to others. Index funds have proven to be a safe yet effective investment vehicle that has built wealth for many people for many generations. Users can log in, chat about index funds with others, and view up-to-date information about the recommended funds.

## User Stories
* As a user I want to be able to add index funds that I want to recommend to others using
* As a user, I want to be able to delete index funds that I don't want to recommend to others anymore
* As a user, I want to be able to edit the recommendation box on the fund and update how I feel about the fund.
* As a user, I want to be able to see information about the fund such as the price and then the year-to-date return

### MVP Goals
* Full CRUD functionality
* Pull info from API
* Well formatted CSS
* Recommendation box for each show page
* Frontend and Backend working with no-issues

### Stretch Goals
* User Sign in/Authorization 
* Creating a chat/ reply feature
* User data model

## Limitations and stretch goals
Due to limitations from the API calls, the app is only configured to give up-to-date information about the current price of the fund. However, if there were no limitation in the API or if there is a less restrictive API out there, the app will be fully capable of providing updated information on anything such as dividends distributed to the historical price.
Currently the chat feature is logged in under one user however as a stretch goal the team has full capability to modify the chat functionality so that the user that logged in will have access to their own chat history and messages.
We want to go back and add our own user authentication to connect the user data to our back-end. Due to time-constraints we pivoted to using Auth0 instead.
